			"title": "Opening of Outlaw Express",
			"description": "<p>The opening of Outlaw Express will be modified on Wednesday, December 22nd due to the need for 2-3 more days of snowmaking temperatures and/or significant natural snow. The lift is operational and will open for scenic lift rides for season pass holders from 11 am - 2 pm. The new beginner area with 3 magic carpets will be open for ski lessons and pass holders. Additionally, our new modern BBQ restaurant, The Lookout, will open from 10:30 am - 3:30 pm. We will celebrate the grand opening of Outlaw Express and The Lookout with ribbon cutting at 11 am. Come for churros, music, hot cocoa, coffee, and prizes! ⁠</p><p>⁠</p><p>Our snowmaking efforts were initially focused on the terrain around Jakes lift for opening last Saturday. Due to the impact of the current inversion snowmaking has not been productive on the front mountain, however the upcoming storm cycle looks to push out the inversion with significant snowfall and colder temperatures on the way. Scenic lift rides will continue on Outlaw Express for season pass holders until the lift opens for skiing.⁠</p><p>⁠</p><p>We are excited for skiing and boarding on the back mountain as well which will be possible with an additional 6-8” of natural snow. Please watch our social media channels for updates on all openings which we will provide by 5 pm everyday until we open for skiing on Outlaw Express and the back mountain.</p>",
