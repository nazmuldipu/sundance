                        <p>In 1970, Robert Redford built the first building at Sundance Mountain Resort: The Tree Room, a cabin constructed around an actual tree. Since then, the restaurant has grown but maintains its rustic, intimate atmosphere while serving some of the best cuisine in the area.</p>
                        <p>Face Coverings are recommended. Guests may remove their face coverings to enjoy food &amp; beverage.</p>
